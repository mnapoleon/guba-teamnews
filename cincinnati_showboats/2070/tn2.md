2069 : The Bad and the Ugly

2069 was pretty much all bad.  

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_62779.html]Mitch Hayes[/url], he of 40 HRs and 111 RBIs, was pretty bad despite those numbers.  He was mostly the DH with some limited time at 1B, RF and LF.  As many have said in the chat or in forum comments he would be more valuable and maybe passbale in RF.  In 2069 I wanted to test him and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54459.html]Jati Pamungkas[/url] in all the same positions.  Pamungkas struggle out of the gate and the idea was sheleved prettly quickly.  Hayes settled into DH role and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_51459.html]Roy Barclay[/url] regained his first base starting role.  I think 2070 will probably start with Hayes as a bench bat as I really want to focus on [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_61258.html]Mao Yan[/url] playing RF (at least against righties) and see what he can do.  One pf Hayes or Pamungkas probably end up in AAA at some point because carrying two guys in the roster who really can't field is tough.

The [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_39610.html]Philippe Allemand[/url] and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_41557.html]Gabriel Alonso[/url] experiments went poorly to say the least.  Signed in hopes of flipping them for something at some point didn't happen.  Allemand got hurt just about every other sim with little nagging injuries and was eventually just released.  At some point I started playing the waiver wire game with Alonso and forgot on sim to move him back to the roster and he got released.  Not the end of the world as I have the finances to deal with the mistake but not something I actually wanted to do.  

And the ugly was that only 2 batters on my team had a WPA greater than 0.  [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_51459.html]Roy Barclay[/url], who according to Joel's "Off the Bench' feature is the most ordinary first baseman in the league and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_60280.html]Yoriyoshi Noguchi[/url].  Noguchi is easily the best hitter in my entire organization.
