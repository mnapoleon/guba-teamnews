2069 : The Good

I sure hope I can get 200 words out of 'The Good' of the 2069 season for the Showboats.

Actually there were a couple of decent performances from some guys in my bullpen.  

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_41206.html]Don Burton[/url] was one of two players the Showboats sent to the All-Star game.  Burton was able to rack up 2.2 WAR in just 64 2/3 innings.  Like Matt (KC) said in his feature Burton needs more innings.  I did make in a stopper/7th inning or greater with a high leverage secondary role a few times last season but then 'Autoed' by staff after one of the many injuries and would forget to set him back for a few sims.  

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_49077.html]Christian Andreoulakis[/url] was a minor league free agent signing last off season who managed to sneak onto the roster and become the setup man to Burton for most of the season.  Not sure how he managed the 1.1 WAR and 10.1 K/9 despite his 'nothing to write home about' ratings.  He did out perform his FIP by about half a run so I sure that help some.  Probably monster regression waiting to happen here.

Another huge contribution in the pen came from [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_59524.html]Belen Kotsiopoulos[/url].  He contributed big time with 90 innings in just 40 appearances out of the bullpen and was excellent.  He managed to give up just 3 HRs in those 90 innings to go along with a 2.39/2.86 ERA/FIP combo.  Like Andreoulakis he probably has some regression coming as his .267 BABIP allowed probably isn't sustainable long term.

Strong bullpen on a rebuilding team kind of is a drag.  Hard to get excited about guys that are really regulars.
