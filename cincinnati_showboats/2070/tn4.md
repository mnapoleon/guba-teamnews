Centerfield is one of those white whale positions in the GUBA.  You want the good bat, the great outfield range as well as a really good arm.  I'm sure speed is a plus as well but given the other things I'm sure we would all give up the speed.  

Here is a look at past, current and future centerfield in Cincinnati.  

Last year I traded Armando Marino away near the deadline.  He has been the starting center fielder in Cincinnati for a few season but really was just about as fringey as you can get at the position I think.  Just 17 range and 11 arm.  More a left fielder than center but you work with what you got.

With Marino shipped out I didn't have many choices that looked big league ready.  No one on the big league roster had even close to the 17 range of Marino.  AAA had a few guys that were like Marino defensively, [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_59491.html]Vassi Elpatievsky[/url] and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_58986.html]Voitto Koskela[/url], but were pretty much garbage bats. Elpatievsky ended up with the job as his bat was slightly better than Koskela and his range/arm combo of 17/15 was also better than Koskela's 17/11.  This was definitely a take the defense over the offense at centerfield.  There wasn't anyone else whose bat was good enough to warrent a huge drop in defense after these two guys.

2070 is starting with Elpatievsky in center for the Showboats as no one else in the system was ready.  The future in center field doesn't seem much brighter either.  2068 1st round pick [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_58986.html]Juan Guzman[/url] just got to AA this season but is almost fully dev'd except for his power and does have the 19 OF range.  If he has a decent 1st half in AA he might make a jump to the bigs this season.  His arm is a little light at 13 but I think I can live with it.
The only other bat in the system with a OF range at 17 or above is [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_47030.html]Pedro Mendez[/url] who was a 3rd rounder from 2069 and his bat is just miserable.
