Lets take a look at some rookies.

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_51123.html]Sherman Weaver[/url] - 3B - Weaver came over from Christchurch in the 2068 when I traded [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54546.html]Artie Williams[/url] away in the beginning of the rebuild.  Weaver has exceeded expectations so far.  He has put together a slightly above average offense season.  He has been able to mix in a bit of power and a bit of speed to go long with surprising good defense at 3B.  Definitly not an OBP machine but I'll take what I can get at this point.  On pace to finished 2070 with a 4.5 WAR which isn't somehting I expected from his ever.  Maybe 2070 is a fluke but I'm happy with him to this point.

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_57728.html]Kyeong-eon Cho[/url] - DH - Cho was the only player in the Showboats system I remember having any offensive potential when I took over but of course he was a righted-handed player with no ability to play the field at any position. To date this season he has be slightly below average hitter and just lost his starting DH job against RHP to [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_57612.html]Wen Huang[/url].  Cho may get another chance in the future but who knows.  

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_60424.html]Jesus Guzman[/url] - CF - Guzman was called up in mid-May to replace the crappy [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_59491.html]Vassi Elpatievsky[/url] in centerfield.  Guzman has definitely solidified the middle of the outfield.  He is still developing at the plate.  He will never wow the GUBA with his bat but a 20-rated CF with 14 contact and potential 11-power should be fine.  He has been a below average hitter through half a season without supplying any power.

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_53997.html]Jacek Bugno[/url] - SS - a late call-up as I was getting sick of shitty defense at SS.  Bugno is a no-bat all defense SS option.  Surprisigly he has already put up 1.3 WAR in 45 starts.  Somehow he is holding his own at the plate (for now) with subpar ratings in all the hitting categories.  He will do as a stop gap until his performance levels off to match his ratings.
