Gotta get to 16 PPTs with this team , gotta get to 16 PPTs with this team....Ok here we go.

Might as well start with some pre-arby pre-free agency stuff.

Lineup regulars [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_52742.html]Trace Castor[/url] (13/17/11/11/13 Ratings) and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_58238.html]Armando Marino[/url] (12/15/6/12/15 Ratings) have reached arbitration and will be getting raises and each should go from league minimum to about $2 million.  On the pitching side a whole group of decent players are getting offers.  This group includes [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_48461.html]Dieter Kirac[/url] (17/11/13 Ratings), [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_48582.html]Fraser Bond[/url] (17/12/11 Ratings), [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_41206.html]Don Burton[/url] (19/13/15 Ratings) and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_51419.html]Ik-jun Chong[/url] (20/10/13 Ratings). There are a couple of other guys with offers but they aren't worth mentioning. 

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_49739.html]Rhett Weichard[/url] (16/19/15/11/15 Ratings) appears to be the team shithead but is going to get an arby tender.  He should have the ability to hit very well and maybe is trade bait to a team looking for a guy with some pop and not much of a rating split.
The last guy I considered not offering arby to was [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_48122.html]Eduardo Maldonado[/url] (11/14/12/11/12 Ratings) but figured I may as well keep him around since he is ok I don't have a ton of options at third base anyway.

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_43436.html]Caden Becker[/url] (12/16/13/10/12 Ratings) is the only player who isn't getting tendered an offer.  He spent all of last season in the minors and he just isn't any good so bye-bye Becker.

As for upcoming free agents I don't plan to extend any of the small group I have.  I would have liked to keep [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_38059.html]Hans Bokvist[/url] (14/13/16 Ratings) just for his back of the rotation potential but he wants to test free agency.  Good luck Hans.  The other guys are [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_37089.html]Tomas Avalos[/url] (9/13/12/19/10 Ratings), [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_41633.html]Quincy Carter[/url] (11/12/13/9/14 Ratings), [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_45511.html]Jimmy Evans[/url] (13/12/13/18/10 Ratings) and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_45218.html]Alex Henderson[/url] (13/11/17 Ratings).  Carter was decent in a backup corner outfielder role in 2068.  Henderson was forgetable.  Evans was in the minors all season as was Avalos.
