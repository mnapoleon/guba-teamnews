The first shoe in the rebuild of the Showboats/MaybeTeamToBeRenamedLater has dropped and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_50183.html]Olaf Krszeszewski[/url] has been traded.  Olaf was sent west to Kansas City in a deal for a 2070 1st round pick, almost sure to be a playoff first, former 1st round pick [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_60417.html]Pierre Andre[/url] and IFA darling [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_62763.html]Brett[/url] Hoover.  The Showboats will also be retaining 50% of Krszeszewski's $26 million per season salary.

I figured any trade involving Olaf was going to include salary retention and the more I agreed to retain the better the return.  The minor league system in Cincinnati is basically a bare cupboard so in any deal I was looking for the best prospects I could manage so I was prepared for high salary retention as well.

Cliche mentioned in his trade review piece that Hoover was probably a late lottery pick type player and I was happy to get someone of that quality given Olaf's salary baggage.  Hoover and Andre are both super young and there is quite a bit of risk here on my end.  I certainly don't want to end up with some duds in 3-4 years while still paying Olaf.  Given that my system is pretty bare I liked the go younger route though.  

I had a few other offers for Olaf that ranged from basic salary dump type offers to more polished but not as high end as Hoover.  In the end it was more just about upside.
