How is the Showboats potential lineup shaping up for the start of 2069....let us see.

[b]Catchers[/b]

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_62748.html]Aurelio Catrunfo[/url] (10/13/12/13/12 Ratings) - RHB
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_50058.html]Abizar Kartodirdjo[/url] (10/15/6/12/12 Ratings) - SHB

Catrunfo was an off season IFA acquistion and will be surplanting Kartodirdjo as the everyday catcher to start the season.  Rating wise Catrunfo just looks like he should be the more consistent hitter overall all.  If Catrunfo struggles though Kartodirdjo will definitly be slipping back in that as the starter.  We also have rookie last season rookie [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_56435.html]Scott Jones[/url] (11/17/10/10/13 Ratings) waiting in AAA.  I don't expect a ton of production from any of these guys but catcher is a mess all over the league it seems.

[b]First Base[/b]

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_51459.html]Roy Barclay[/url] (15/16/10/13/17 Ratings) - RHB
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54459.html]Jati Pamungkas[/url] (14/15/15/12/11 Ratings) - LHB

Barclay is the only true first basemen on the roster but I think Pamungkas will get more reps at first base to start the season then Barclay at least against right handed pitching.  I really want to get both Pamungkas and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_62779.html]Mitch Hayes[/url] (10/15/19/11/9 Ratings) in the lineup at the same time and that means one of them gets to be a very shitty first basemen.  Pamungkas gets his chance first.  Barclay will definitely slip into the lineup vs lefties though.

[b]Second Base/Third Base/Shortstop[/b]

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_52486.html]Eijiro Honda[/url] (10/15/10/14/9 Ratings) - RHB
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_52892.html]Dean de Coster[/url] (13/14/8/8/18 Ratings) - LHB
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_49740.html]Ki-seop Ch'oe[/url] (12/18/10/12/15 Ratings) - RHB
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_53930.html]Daniel Moulin[/url] (10/11/7/6/15 Ratings) - RHB

There is no true shortstop in this group so de Coster will get that spot.  Honda will take second base and Ch'oe will get third. Really this guys would play over of the infield.  Moulin is probably the best to play shortstop but I don't want his bat in the lineup everyday so he get to be the utility/defense sub of this group.  de Coster has a decent season at that plate in 2068 but I doubt he can repeat that over a full season.  Ch'oe is in the same boat.  Not sure what to expect from Honda as he has never taken a big league at bat but he was really good in spring training.  

[b]Outfield[/b]

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_57612.html]Wen Huang[/url] (14/15/14/13/14 Ratings) - LHB
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_58238.html]Armando Marino[/url] (12/15/6/12/15 Ratings) - SHB
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_60280.html]Yoriyoshi Noguchi[/url] (14/16/14/11/12 Ratings) - RHB
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_61258.html]Mao Yan[/url] (16/16/2/5/18 Ratings) - LHB
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_53914.html]Young-lau Zhou[/url] (11/14/10/11/10 Ratings) - RHB

There is no true center fielder in this group but some good bats.  Marino is the only real option for CF so he get to play everyday even with the bad split against lefties.  Huang and Noguchi make a nice hitting combo in the corners but neither is going to wow you with defense.  Hayes has the big power in the lineup but I want to get Huang and Noguchi in the lineup as well so Hayes gets pushed to DH and from above you know Pamungkas gets a chance at first base.  Yan and Zhou are the bench bats. Yan probably should be in the lineup as well but there just are enough spots.
