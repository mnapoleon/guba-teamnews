Between the guys still on the roster, Rule 5 draft picks, Ping coming off the DL and free agents signings the Showboats were running into some roster crunch already.  This was mostly caused by 10 Rule 5 draft picks.  Knowing my team was going to need to get filled out after mass exodus from minor league free agents I loaded up the Rule 5 draft list.  In the end I drafted 10 guys which was helpful until I started signing free agents.  Roster crunch in December.

Almost right way 6 guys were sent back to free up some 40-man room.  Shortstops [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_56635.html]Dave Bradley[/url] and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54974.html]Habib Auger[/url] were released to make room in the infield for free agent signed  [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_49740.html]Ki-seop Ch'oe[/url] and to allow [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_39838.html]Ling-lai Ping[/url] a spot as well. With Ping most likely getting moved I didn't really need the spot but I did have some other FA offers out and wanted to make the space anyway.  Along with those 2 third basemen [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_56072.html]Dale Cherry[/url], outfielder [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_60455.html]Trent Grant[/url] and pitchers [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_50069.html]Jose Cano[/url] and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_55536.html]Antan Agosto[/url] were releases back to their original teams.  I would have likfed to have kept Grant but I just didn't see him sticking around given he has a career 19 plate appearances above short A ball.

That left just pitchers [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_53174.html]Than Liberoyiannis[/url], [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54506.html]Luis Aguirre[/url], [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_57184.html]Chong-yee Rong[/url] and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54204.html]Jeremy Mckinna[/url] as the remaining draftees left.  Liberoyiannis and Rong will both be getting starting rotation shots with Liberoyiannis being a follower to see how things go.  Aguirre and Mckinna are just middle relief arms that could easily be jettison before the season starts depending on how things go.
