Free agency is obviously not a place where the Showboats would be playing in the deep end of the pool.  I would need to at least get into the low end to add to the current roster though.  I had a few goals with free agency.  First was to get big league caliber guys on the cheap to fill out the roster and second was to try an nab a few guys who might have some value to other teams at the deadline provided they were able to perform.

Catcher [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_62748.html]Aurelio Catrunfo[/url] and outfielder [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_53914.html]Young-lau Zhou[/url] are part of the big league caliber and cheap category.  With Catrunfo I was just trying to get someone as an upgrade to [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_50058.html]Abizar Kartodirdjo[/url].  Catching seems like a wasteland at this point so it seems more like a try someone out and see what happens as opposed to really finding a sure thing, especially in my siutation.  Zhou is really just in Cincinnati as a reserve.  

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_39610.html]Philippe Allemand[/url] is squarely in the other camp.  I have no need for him but if he is able to pitch well enough he could be a pretty decent deadline pickup for another team and the $1.1 million contract made it almost a no-brainer.  If he isn't traded it was worth the chance.

The only other non minor league contract went to infielder [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_49740.html]Ki-seop Ch'oe[/url].  Ch'oe sort of straddles that line between the two groups.  I signed him to originally move to third base thinking I wouldn't be able to move Ping.  If Ping does move Ch'oe probably slides back to second base.  If Ch'oe can succeed be might also be a small trade chip come the deadline.  He performed pretty well in limited plate appearance last season in San Juan.  I'm not under any illusions he will be that good over a full season but it was worth a shot and he filled a few holes this team had.
