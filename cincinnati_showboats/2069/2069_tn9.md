2069 is going according to plan here in Cincinnati.  We are the worst team in the league...actually that is Sydney some how.  At least we are close.  The rebuilding Island Kings, after a hot start, have finally joined us in the race to the bottom.  Of course when you have a team this bad it is hard to keep yourself interested during the season and even more so when there isn't a lot left to move.

My best player and probable All-Star has been closer [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_41206.html]Don Burton[/url].  Burton leads the Showboats pitchers in WAR with 1.2 and was leading all MBBA relievers at the time I looked at the All-Star ballot.  Of course he is a reliever so hard to keep interested in what I guy that pitches a few innings a sim is doing.

Off-season IFA signing [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_62779.html]Mitch Hayes[/url] has probably been the most interesting player.  He has 19 home runs to this point, just 2 off the league lead.  Of course he is also sporting that 0.0 WAR which is just from the negatives he had earlier.  Last two sims have seem him drop 9 dingers to start to right himself.  

Free agent signing and hopeful trade bait [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_39610.html]Philippe Allemand[/url] is injured for the 5th time since March so I doubt there will be many interested in a guy that gets injured every other sim, even if they are minor injuries to this point.  He may just get DFA's at some point as my 40-man is full and I'm holding some dudes on the 60-day IL to avoid having to waiver others.  

Not much else to say at this point.
