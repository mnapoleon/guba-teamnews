Seeing as I haven't been a GM in this league in a decade of in game time I figured a team preview would help me refamiliarize myself with some of it's players.  This will also allow others to tell me that my evaulation of player is way off given changes in the leagues since I last was a GM.  I wanted to start with a division rival as well as a middle of the pack type team.  No better place than the Philadelphia Brewers.

[u]Starting Rotation[/u]
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_61746.html]Andre Chapple[/url] - RH

The last spot in the rotation...
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_42795.html]Al Davis[/url] - RH
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_46542.html]Bruce Miller[/url] - RH / [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_52423.html]Amilcar Trovo[/url] - LH

Chapple looks like a true ace after his first season in the bigs.  He finished up 2nd in RoY voting in 2068 after starting the season in AAA.  At just past 23 years of age coming into 2069 he could be the anchor of the Brewers rotation for years to come. 
Along with Chapple the Brewers have some very good young pitchers in 24 year olds Thorne and Bijkerk.  Neither are as good as Chapple but both are good young middle of the rotation type pieces that should provide stability to the Brewers rotation going forward.  

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_48083.html]Jason Potter[/url] had a break out second season in the GUBA and should provide solid pitching in the top half of the the rotation despite a shaky spring. 

The last spot should/would have gone to [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_46542.html]Bruce Miller[/url] based on ratings but he hasn't pitched hince 2067 with elbow issues.  Miller's stamina now sits at 6 and I'm not sure that makes him a started anymore. 2067 saw Miller make 34 starts and pitcher over 210 innings but I can't see him getting anywhere near that in 2069.

Trovo is just a guy with no velocity and basically throws junk. Maybe Miller and Trovo do the opener/follower thing to get through 6 innings and leave it to the bullpen after that.

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_42795.html]Al Davis[/url] at 32 years old executed his $16million option fro 2069 after a very down year.  His FIP and ERA were basically the same and he posted a career low K/9 of just 6.3 as well as posting his worst HR/9 since the season he lead the league in home runs allowed with 44 back in 2061.  Davis could start the season in the rotation but I could also see him floatingon the waiver wire quite a bit.

[b]Rotation Grade : B+[/b]

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_58726.html]Javier Alvarez[/url] - RH

That is a list of 8 guys from the spring training bullpen.... and I can't really tell them apart.  The second Chapple on the team that looks like the best player at his position ....Diaz throws gas....Olliver just looks solid....Krieger is the returning save leader but also just below replacement level...Mahler is a decent middle reliever...Vazquez is the lefty because you need one and Alvarez because he had a decent season in 2068 and could start. Not all these guys make the team and the 7 that do are a bullpen. Not much else to say with this group.  

[b]Bullpen Grade: B- (but who knows)[/b]

[b]Batters[/b]

[b]Catcher[/b]
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_51003.html]Gin-fan Yap[/url] - RHB
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_53932.html]Teklu Marango[/url] - SHB

I haven't look at every team but Yap is the best one offensive catchers in the GUBA while being a so-so defensive catcher.  Backing up Yap is Marango who was an off season free agent.  Marango has good chops behind the plate with a decent enough bat to not kill you when Yap needs a day off. 

[b]Catcher Grade: B+[/b]

[b]First Base/DH[/b]
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_58980.html]Cheuk-yan Seema[/url] - RHB
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54094.html]Pedro Lazu[/url] - RHB

Seema is a good defensive first basemen with some pop and now that he looks ready for full time GUBA action it allows Lazu the ability to become the full time DH.  Both have 25-30 HR potential and Lazu is still good enough to play the field should Seema struggle in his first full GUBA season.

[b]First Base/DH Grade: B+[/b]

[b]Second Base[/b]
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_51209.html]Floyd Malone[/url] - RHB

Malone is obviously a stud at the plate with 40 HR potential and .900 OPS.  The former 1st overall pick and lived up too the hype. His one downside is that he isn't a 2nd basemen. Given his 12 range with 16 arm I wonder if he really should be playing third base.  It looks like Malone was geting some play at 3B during spring training so that is a good sign. 

[b]Second Base Grade : A-[/b]

[b]Third Base[/b]
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_40076.html]Simone Bajanca[/url] - RHB

Bajanca is an above average bat but aging.  He but put decent numbers in 2068 and that probably keeps him around for another season.  He probably shouldn't be playing third base anymore with his IF range of 3.  It is like he is wearing cement shoes out there.  If Bajanca's bat falters I could see Malone moving to the hot corner and youner player moving to second. 

[b]Third Base Grade : C unless see above on Malone
[/b]
[b]Shortstop[/b]
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_49993.html]Eugenia Koumanidis[/url] - RHB

Koumanidis is a 5 time All-Star at one of the hardest position to find a decent hitter and great fielder.  Koumanidis is still both of those but his defense is slipping a bit.  Koumanidis is the tons of hits, lead the league in batting average type hitter.  He gets a lot of extra base hits with almost no power and barely walks.  Despite that he is one of the top offensive SS in the GUBA.

[b]Shortstop Grade : A
[/b]
[b]Outfield[/b]

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54521.html]Felix Atyasov[/url] - RHB - LF
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_50001.html]Karl Simmons[/url] - RHB - RF
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_42485.html]Chris Booth[/url] - SHB - CF

Now we come to the true weakness of the Brewers.  Atyasov is a great hitter and excellent defender in left.  The 3 time all-star is a true middle of the order bat.  
After that the outfield is kind of a mess. Simmons is a good right fielder but just a so-so hitter.  He has good speed but doesn't get on base enough to be a lead off hitter.  
Now we come to center field.  My god this is a mess.  Booth's range in 17, probably the lowest you want to go in center but his arm suck.  To go along with that arm you have the bat of a waiver wire utility infielder.  There are no other options are center for the Brewers either.  If I were the GM I would consider trading for anyone to replace Booth or even bring up [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_60254.html]Okitsugu Shimizu[/url] from single A as there is nothing in AAA or AA to help.  

[b]Outfield Grade : C  [/b]

[b]The Bench[/b]
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_58253.html]Eduardo Gonzalez[/url] - RHB - IF
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54386.html]Manolo Valverde[/url] - SHB - IF

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_51088.html]Jim Stewart[/url] - RHB - OF
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_55677.html]Arthur Schlesser[/url] - RHB - OF

Assuming 4 bats on the bench to go with the back up catcher I went with the only two infielder that weren't first basemen.  They are both ok bats, nothing special and they are probably best suited for second and third base if they need to start.

Again outfield is a mess with no on in the minors close to ready so Stewart and Schlesser seemed to be the best combination left of hitting and some defense.

[b]Bench Grade : D[/b]



Overall Outlook:  I really like the young rotation with a ace at the top of very good arms in the next 2 to 3 sopts.  The final rotation spot is iffy but I would say most teams never truly happy with the 5th spot.  The bullpen is just a bullpen. Not much else to say. 
I love the offense on paper from the infield hitters with just Bajanca being a possible question mark going forward at the plate.  The defense seems fine at first and shortstop but Malone should be considered for a move to third if a better hitting second basemen can be found or Bajanca defensive at third doesn't hold up.  The outfield is a mess after Atyasov with no help coming.  

[b]Overall Team Grade : B[/b]

[b]Prediction 85-77[/b] with wild card berth.  They aren't going to win the division with Nashville around and Cape Cod didn't get worse.  Toronto improved so it should be a good battle.  Cincinnati and Greenville are a mess so no worries there.
