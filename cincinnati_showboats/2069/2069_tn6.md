Time to take a look at the Showboats 2069 pitching staff.  

[b]Starting Rotation[/b]

Now that Olaf Krszeszewski is in Kansas City the team has a new #1. Second year starterr [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_59769.html]Dan Bradley[/url] takes over.  Of course Bradley won't be getting the opening day start due to an ill timed started near the end of spring training.  Bradley is former 2nd round pick with middle of the road stuff and above average control.  His 0.9 HR/9 with 11 movement might not reproducible over a full season.  His rating say he should be the best pitcher on the Shotboats.

The Showboats also have two other hold overs from last season's rotations in lefties [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_48582.html]Fraser Bond[/url] and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_51419.html]Ik-jun Chong[/url].  Bond is your typical back of the rotation pitcher.  He has been decent but not great each of the past two seasons while spending time bounching between the rotation and the bullpen.  Chong had great stuff with an excellent changeup, fastball and slider.  Middling movement and averagish control really limit his ceiling.  

The two newcomers to the starting rotation are veteran Gabrial Alonso and Rule 5 pickup [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_53174.html]Than Liberoyiannis[/url].  Alonso has been a decent arm that has pitch over or close to 200 innings in each season since 2058 with his lowest total being 188.2 innnings in 2064.  At just $6 million a season for the next 3 years I thought he was a bargin while brining some leadership to the team.  At the very least he can be a trade chip come deadline time.  Alonso will get getting the ball on opening day due to Bradley not being available. 
Liberoyiannis was very good in AAA for Christchruch last season in just 6 starts all year despite no injuries.  He made 4 appearances as a follower in spring training and was very good.  He allowed 9 hits, 4 walks and just 1 run over 16 innings.  That was enough to get him a spot.  Plus I want to keep him around.

Other possibilties over the course of the season to start are rule 5 pickups [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_57184.html]Chong-yee Rong[/url] and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54506.html]Luis Aguirre[/url] as well as [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_43090.html]David Dial[/url] who will start the season in AAA as he has yet to pitch above A ball in his career.  Dial was very good in spring training but between no experience above single A and me want to keep some rule 5 guys a bit longer there was no room for him.

[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_39610.html]Philippe Allemand[/url] is also with the team but will be starting the season on the DL with a minor injury.  When he returns he should slot into either Chong or Liberoyiannis' spot in the rotation.  With any luck he pitches decent and I can trade him for something later in the season.



[b]Bullpen[/b]
The Showboats bullpen is close [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_41206.html]Don Burton[/url] and just a bunch of guys.  Burton is definitely the back of the bullpen piece with great stuff for high level situations and has closed in on 100 innning pitched each of the last 2 seasons.  After Burton though the bullpen really is just a bunch off guys.

The rule 5 guys mentioned above, [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_57184.html]Chong-yee Rong[/url] and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54506.html]Luis Aguirre[/url], could be used as starters, long relief or emergency starters. Lefty [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_48461.html]Dieter Kirac[/url] fits that mold as well and could easily seem time as a starter if anyone struggles.  That leaves [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_49077.html]Christian Andreoulakis[/url] and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54204.html]Jeremy Mckinna[/url] as the setup guys and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_59524.html]Belen Kotsiopoulos[/url] as the whatever guy.  I fully expect this bullpen to struggle and expect one of Agurrie or Rong to get sent back to their original teams to make room for a [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_43090.html]David Dial[/url] call up.
