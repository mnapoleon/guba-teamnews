Figured I would write about this while it was still a thing because I doubt it lasts.

Triple A, non-prospect [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_56387.html]Kade Van buizen[/url] (12/14/13/11/13 Ratings) is off to a blistering start to the AAA season.  The kiwi has played in just 23 of Tel Aviv's 32 games and already accumlated 2.0 WAR with 10 homers and 22 RBIs.  In 2068 he got to 2.9 WAR between time in AA and A over 92 games so he is on pace for a career minor league season.  
I figured his 2.0 WAR and 10 homers so far had to be leading all of AAA  but no go.  A couple GUBA vets are raking in AAA as well.  Jose Gutierrez of San Antonio had already acculated 2.5 WAR in 20 AAA games before being called up and GUBA vet [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_27154.html]Roger O'Day[/url] (10/10/17/14/13 Ratings) of Wellington (CHC) has already hit 16 bombs against AAA pitching in 29 starts.  

Van buizen is tied for second in AAA WAR at 2.0 with Brewer farm hand [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_50001.html]Karl Simmons[/url] (12/16/13/11/12 Ratings).  Hard to figured out why Simmons is in AAA with [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_44984.html]Nelson Alvarado[/url] (10/8/15/17/13 Ratings) struggling for Philly up in the GUBA.  Simmons is the better bat and fielder and yet Alvarado has been allowed to sport his almost -1 WAR and struggle defensively with a guy like Simmmons waiting around.  

Oops I turned this into anothers piece about the Brewers.
