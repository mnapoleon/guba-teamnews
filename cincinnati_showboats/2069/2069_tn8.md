The 2069 draft for the Showboats has been about getting guys... any guys.  I would love to lock down some top end, no doubt talent but this draft didn't really have that.  Instead it was just stock pile young guys and hope for some bumpers.  I guess that is no different than anyone else at this point.  

Really it was best available anywhere for the Showboats.  The draft had a deeper pitcher crop than hitter crop so I figured I could get similiar enough pitchers to those available in the 1st with my 3 second round picks so I went best available bat.

1st Round - Pick #9 overall
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_44164.html]Ron Carpenter[/url] - LF - 19 years old 
Carpenter has a power back with a decent enough eye and ok contact skills.  He has decent speed but that doesnt' translate to any current defensive ability.  He project to be just barely passable as a corner outfielder.  His 14 infield range is intruiging but he has no infield arm to speak of so I guess we have a future first basemen.  I was considering closer [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_61883.html]Todd King[/url] in this spot but just couldn't pull the trigger on a closer this earlier given my teams needs all over the place.

My second round picks were all spent on pitchers.  
2nd Round - Pick #33 overall
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_44885.html]Sisto Gosende[/url] - LHP - 19 years old
Gosende has 4 solid pitches (or the potential for 4 solid pitches) and the potential 13 movement which is what drew me to him here.  Nothing spectacular but solid enough. High work ethic so hope for some bumping here. 

2nd Round - Pick #41 overall
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_62355.html]Maxim Stuut[/url] - LHP - 19 years old
Stuut has 5 pitches and a nice 14/12/14 potential and like Gosende he is a lefty.  Again just a guy who looks like mid to bad end rotation type

2nd Round - Pick #50 overall
[url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_43964.html]Greg Ryan[/url] - RHP - 19 years old
Ryan looks to be a closer with just two solid pitches and the shitty changeup hanging around.  If the changeup can bump at all and with his 15 stamina he could sneak into a rotation. As a reliever I really wished his velocity was better than sitting 91-93.  And his nickname is 'Schnozz'... that is kind of cool.

Not a great group for the my first draft back but the draft didn't really give us much to work with.
