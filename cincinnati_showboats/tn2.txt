A week in and still getting familiar with the Showboats.  The minor leagues has quite a few over 30 guys that were just sucking up playing time from youngsters.  Spend a few exports weeding those guys out.  Those old guys were spread out pretty good in to the org too so I can only guess there were was minor signings and then forgotten about as well as maybe the minors being auto'd.  At this point I've got all the teams down to less than 30 player and gotten rid of the old guys.

I was also able to move a couple of starting pitchers who I would call superfluous to my team.  [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_46674.html]Gilbert Leslie[/url] was shipped off to Moscow in exchange for [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_43090.html]David Dial[/url] (2068 2nd draft pick) and a 2069 3rd round pick.  Leslie was coming up on a player option decision that I would guess he will decline based on his asking price during extension talks.  Dial seems ok but could definitely use a few control bumps if he wants to be a starter or some stuff bumps to become more than average middle relief.

We were also able to obtain what will probably be a late 2nd round pick in 2070 from Bogota for [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_47690.html]Mark Monroe[/url].  To be honest when cliche asked about Monroe was convinced he DM'd the wrong GM because I didn't remember having anyone named Monroe.  Monroe was having decent enough year for the Showboats but at 36 years on and his contract expiring after this season I was happy to get a 2nd round pick for him.
