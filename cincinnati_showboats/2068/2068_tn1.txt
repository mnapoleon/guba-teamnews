Back in the GUBA and back in Cincinnati.  The Showboats are great but they are in better shape then when I took them over in [url=http://thefibb.net/forums/index.php?topic=224528.0]2055[/url].  This may be the first time I've taken over a team that was a financial wreck since I first join the GUBA with Athens way back when.

The pitching staff at first glance seems pretty deep with decent pitchers but no true ace.  [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_50183.html]Olaf Krszeszewski[/url]  is damn close though.  The staff seems movement deficient but looknig at league pitching stats indicates the Showboats aren't giving up the long ball any than the rest of the league.  Where the Showboats really excel is control.  Cincinnati is just beating out Nashville for least walks allowed to this point in the season. 

Where the Showboats really struggle is the plate.  The team's run differential is better than only the lowly Moonshiners and Orbits in all of the GUBA.  The team has next to no power in the lineup and are second to last in the league with 88 homers.  The Orbits again are the only team worse.  The offense is lead by a couple of old timers in [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_39838.html]Ling-lai Ping[/url] and [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_39801.html]Lorenzo Perez[/url].  

What really hurts in the worst ranked farm system in the GUBA and an empty International Complex.  My other tries in the GUBA saw me almost immediately go into a rebuild but I can't stomach that this time.  Go to see how things go without dumping everything of value.  It will probably result in some pretty middle of the road seasons but that seems more appealing to me than checking my rookie league team every sim hoping for bumpers.
