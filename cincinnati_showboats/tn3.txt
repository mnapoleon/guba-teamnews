Trade deadline came and went in Cincinnati with just a few minor moves.  [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_39801.html]Lorenzo Perez[/url] was moved to Nashville for comp return and the 4th round kicker.  Left-handed closer [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_54546.html]Artie Williams[/url] was shipped to Christchurch in exchange pitching prospect [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_56462.html]Dave Baker[/url] and third basemen [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_51123.html]Sherman Weaver[/url].  These deals both came together on late as there was talk for days prior of both players getting shipped together in another deal that eventually fell through.

Despite selling off some of the better players recently the team had been played better than expected recently.  The Showboats went 17-12 in August but have slipped a bit in September with a 10-11 record.  

Some of the bright spots on this team have been star pitcher [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_50183.html]Olaf Krszeszewski[/url] along with shortstop [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_52742.html]Trace Castor[/url] and center fielder [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_58238.html]Armando Marino[/url].  Given the direction of this team I imagine all 3 could be sitting on an off-season trading block pretty soon.

Some other things of note are the Showboats best younger pitcher, [url=http://www.thefibb.net/news/html/players/player_59769.html]Don Bradley[/url] suffered mild shoulder strain a few weeks back and rather have him come off the IL after recover he was shut down for the season as a precaution.

Oh and the Single-A affiliate Amman Kings are currently tied 2 games apiece with the Auckland Warriors for the Single-A championship.  GO Kings!
